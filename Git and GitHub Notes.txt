========================================== Git and GitHub 

Git:- 

{Tool used to collaborate with each other}. Have you ever thought in your life to go back to childhood days just because you were not able to tolerate the responsibilities.
The same way happens with developers as well when ever you want to implement a new feature and by some reason it was breaking the entire code. Rather than creating new project from scratch 
or deleting the written lines by line. If you have an option to go back just in snap that would be useful. Git provides the same feature to go back to the last check point. When I say last check point its your wish you can start coding at whatever check point you wish to do so.

GitHub:- 

GitHub is an online platform where and which we push our whole git folder to the remote repository. When I say remote repository consider it as big folder existed somewhere else on earth and you are storing your code there. So that whenever you require you can pull whatever version of the code that is required.


========================================== Git Commands

1. To initialize git in the project folder : git init {There will be a file created in the project folder named '.git', It will store or track all the changes happened in that folder. To see them in git bash type 'ls -a'}
2. But how the people who were working on the same folder knows that something is changed by ashish or forget about someone how can even I track my project folder that what all changes that I made which are untracked (when I say untracked in the sense I didn't add them to the '.git' folder.). To see this type 'git status

'
3. Ok then now I created a file here in project folder. And now you are about to say that hey git just add it to .git folder when ever I say. Ok Now git will say that ok then please enter command 'git add .'. Here '.' in the sense I am telling git to pick all the files. You can replace them with file names that you want to add.
4. Now the time has come and I want to say git that ok git I revised everything and I am commited to my word to you to say that please save it to '.git' folder. To do that enter 'git commit -m "something to say"'. Now you make your first check point in your product development life cycle.
5. Now my manager came to me and asked what all commits I made till now. To know that press 'git log'.
6. Now I added new file named 'names.txt' and I suddenly deleted it. But I want it back. Then use 'git reset ___Id___'
7. Let say there is a dependency where I am about to commit a feature but suddenly some idea which is better than this feature comes to mind. So rather than commiting this feature or deleting this feature what we can do is I will git that ok git I am trying new but I don't want to lose the current existing feature so store it somewhere else other than .git folder. Ok then type 'git stash'.
8. Ok then I worked on the new feature and it seems like not working so I need pull the stashed work to the staging area so what I will do is like 'git stash pop'. SO whenever I say this command the git will take out the stashed feature and add it to the staging area form where I can commit it.
9. So what if the new feature works and want to clear the stashed code? Then type 'git stash clear'. It clears current existing code in the stashed area.
10. 


======================================= Working with remote repository (GitHub)

1. Ok then till now we have learn about git like saving the checkpoints (continuous progess) at repository. When I say repository it is something limited to my laptop it self. Suppose if my manager want to check my code then how it is possible. The only way is he must to take my laptop open the code and then check it. But what if I move all my check points to the remote folder which I told earlier and then what if I give access to my code to everyone? anycone can see my code and then can make changes right but how to do that.
Go to GitHub create a repository where it will show remote repository URL. Copy that URL and type the command here 'git remote add origin https://github.com/06ashish1999/MyNotesForCourses.git'. Now your .git folder will be moved to remote repo.
